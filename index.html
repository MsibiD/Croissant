      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] ⓘ) is a French pastry made
      from puff pastry in a crescent shape.[1] It is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named
      for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter,
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
